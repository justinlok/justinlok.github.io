Although flash games come with the prenotion of cheap, low-effort quality, there has been a few games that pushed what is possible with flash.

And in comes the Plazma Burst Franchise.

The series is made by an Ukrainian developer Eric Gurt, with the first installment launched in 2011. While the first game wasn't technically remarkable compared to other games like Powder Game, Happy Wheels, or Mutilate a Doll, Plazma Burst 2 showcased the boundaries of what Flash is capable of.

From a glance, the game has:

2D Physics simulation, including character ragdolling.
Lighting and shading for level environments.
Online multiplayer.

But the inclusion of the Advance Level Editor in 2013 is the real shining jewel in the game.
