<p>
Plazmaburst 2 is a web game released in 2011. The addition of a level editor allowed players to create, share, and play with others on custom maps.

<p>
One of the unique features in the level editor is the trigger system, a cause and effect system that players can invoke during gameplay.
There are many ways triggers can be activated. It could be on a timer, a player killing a npc, or a player entering a region of the map. Triggers has over 100+ different actions they can perform upon activation. Things like spawning weapons, moving players, orperforming operations on variables.

<p>
The aformentioned allowed level creators to implement their own gamemodes into the game, with one caveat.

The game does not sync variables from triggers between players, leaving each player to run the level's logic locally on their computer.

Triggers activated outside a player's vision will not activate for that player at all.
This leads to desyncronization between players as level elements are activated for some but not others.
