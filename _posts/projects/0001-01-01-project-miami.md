This is a project I worked on for the CSE 165 course, Introduction to Object Oriented Programing.
I worked on this project with three other people. We were given a time frame of one month.

The constraints the professor game us is as followed:

You must use FreeGLUT or GLUT derived libraries.
Your project design has to revolve around the object oriented paradigm.

Being fans of hotline Miami, we were inspired to make a game in its likeness.
