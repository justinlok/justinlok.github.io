Stop Waiting for Godot was a game jam hosted by Terry Cavanagh, a indie dev that made [VVVVVV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VVVVVV). It was not non-competition and more of an opportunity for to learn the Godot game engine. I led a team of 5 to create a pinball sandbox.

<br>
<p>
Everyone on my team had varying levels of experience programing, which was fine since there were tasks for all skill levels, including tasks that didn't require programing at all.
This was the main reason why we choose to make a pinball game - the modularity of the components. The many bumpers, flippers and other parts of the pinball machine were independent of each other and could be worked on parallel to each other.

<br>
<p>
Overall I consider the jam a success. I got to experiment around with Godot's built in physics engine, something I never really got around to before, as well as designing the components needed to make a functioning level editor. I was also able to share my knowledge of Godot with teammates that had never used Godot before, and they were able to effectively contribute towards the project in the end.
